0:00:00,000 --> 0:00:03,753
Morevna Project presents

2
0:00:07,370 --> 0:00:10,522
“Pepper & Carrot” is an animated adaptation of a comic

3
0:00:10,553 --> 0:00:13,234
by the French artist David Revoy.

4
0:00:13,760 --> 0:00:17,582
David is the original author of the comic and our team is producing an animated version.

5
0:00:17,561 --> 0:00:20,085
Right now we are working on a new episode,

6
0:00:20,126 --> 0:00:22,641
and it is already at the production phase.

7
0:00:23,325 --> 0:00:27,251
I can briefly describe the main steps we go through

8
0:00:27,276 --> 0:00:31,584
to make an animation from the comic

9
0:00:34,000 --> 0:00:37,444
First, the director makes a draft animation

10
0:00:37,469 --> 0:00:43,273
out of static pictures. Here he defines the duration of each scene

11
0:00:43,298 --> 0:00:47,614
and outlines how characters and other objects are moving in the scene.

12
0:00:47,639 --> 0:00:52,110
The scene drawn by the author already implies

13
0:00:52,135 --> 0:00:56,270
some movement in itself. The director has to analyze this movement

14
0:00:56,295 --> 0:00:59,180
and to understand what the author meant by it.

15
0:00:59,275 --> 0:01:02,724
At the same time we record a draft voice soundtrack.

16
0:01:02,749 --> 0:01:06,875
We’re just reading the text aloud here.

17
0:01:06,876 --> 0:01:08,391
Good morning Sir,

18
0:01:08,416 --> 0:01:10,868
I would like eight pumpkin stars, please

19
0:01:10,893 --> 0:01:13,851
Here you are. That's 60 Ko.

20
0:01:13,876 --> 0:01:16,169
Oh dear...

21
0:01:17,574 --> 0:01:21,362
Uhh sorry, I'll have to take only four.

22
0:01:21,387 --> 0:01:22,553
Grrr!

23
0:01:22,578 --> 0:01:25,849
We read aloud and record the words to understand

24
0:01:25,874 --> 0:01:29,593
how much time the dialog will take and get its tempo right.

25
0:01:29,634 --> 0:01:32,325
Simultaneously, we select the music tracks.

26
0:01:32,350 --> 0:01:35,831
So, we create a draft soundtrack and

27
0:01:35,856 --> 0:01:38,139
combine it with the draft visual.

28
0:01:38,164 --> 0:01:41,331
That's what we call an animatic.

29
0:01:41,356 --> 0:01:43,482
It gives us the overall picture

30
0:01:43,507 --> 0:01:47,507
and a general idea of what the animators need to do.

31
0:01:48,506 --> 0:01:50,230
The potion contest

32
0:01:50,255 --> 0:01:53,059
Lucky me, I still have a whole day to prepare!

33
0:01:53,084 --> 0:01:55,409
Let's win this challenge!

34
0:01:55,434 --> 0:01:58,980
During this process we discuss how we could

35
0:01:59,005 --> 0:02:02,508
improve some moments that can be perfectly understandable in the original comic

36
0:02:02,533 --> 0:02:06,291
but need some clarifications when turned into an animation.

37
0:02:06,316 --> 0:02:10,316
So we have the comic, and in fact it has already been directed by the author, right?

38
0:02:10,341 --> 0:02:14,341
The artist drew all of these scenes and arranged them on the page.

39
0:02:14,756 --> 0:02:19,178
However while transforming all this into an animated sequence I see that some of these scenes

40
0:02:19,203 --> 0:02:24,125
need something in between, which will connect the previous scene with the next one.

41
0:02:24,150 --> 0:02:30,204
That’s why sometimes I’m thinking about how to improve the sequence by adding new elements or even whole shots.

42
0:02:30,229 --> 0:02:34,378
For instance, let's look at this scene with Saffron and the coins.

43
0:02:34,403 --> 0:02:37,354
I thought it would be nice to take a close-up

44
0:02:37,379 --> 0:02:39,775
and show her tossing them.

45
0:02:39,959 --> 0:02:44,338
There's no such frame in the original comic, but it connects the scenes

46
0:02:44,363 --> 0:02:48,862
that were there quite well.

47
0:02:48,887 --> 0:02:51,894
When the animatic is ready, we step into the Production phase.

48
0:02:51,919 --> 0:02:55,919
As director of this episode, I have the whole picture in my head

49
0:02:55,944 --> 0:02:59,632
and know how every single scene works. Once all of the scenes are arranged into the animatic, I start assigning the tasks

50
0:02:59,657 --> 0:03:03,657
to the painters and animators.

51
0:03:08,759 --> 0:03:12,077
Every picture has to be cut into parts.

52
0:03:12,102 --> 0:03:15,861
The characters should be separated from the background.

53
0:03:15,886 --> 0:03:20,569
Then we must reconstruct missing parts of the characters or objects,

54
0:03:20,594 --> 0:03:23,905
because when the characters are removed from the background,

55
0:03:23,930 --> 0:03:26,513
we must fill the empty space left behind them.

56
0:03:26,538 --> 0:03:30,997
If a character is meant to move, then some parts of this character

57
0:03:31,022 --> 0:03:34,450
need to be reconstructed and drawn by us. For example in a static picture the hand of the character

58
0:03:34,475 --> 0:03:37,267
can be hidden behind another object. And if the character is moving the hand

59
0:03:37,292 --> 0:03:39,251
then it must also be drawn by us.

60
0:03:39,276 --> 0:03:41,712
Another common case is blinking. We have to draw

61
0:03:41,737 --> 0:03:44,656
closed eyes, opened eyes and half-opened eyes.

62
0:03:44,681 --> 0:03:47,037
I always try to carefully analyze each shot, and formulate the task so that the artist only has to do what's necessary

63
0:03:47,062 --> 0:03:50,450
because I already know which elements are going to be animated

64
0:03:50,475 --> 0:03:53,228
and which are not. So I just say

65
0:03:53,253 --> 0:03:56,331
this part should be separated and that part should not be.

66
0:03:56,356 --> 0:03:59,029
This task is done by our painting artists.

67
0:03:59,054 --> 0:04:02,482
My task is to draw the missing parts

68
0:04:02,507 --> 0:04:05,974
and prepare the artwork for animation.

69
0:04:06,823 --> 0:04:11,694
For drawing and editing pictures we use Krita open source software.

70
0:04:12,062 --> 0:04:16,534
I draw any missing details for the characters, the positions of eyes and mouths,

71
0:04:16,559 --> 0:04:21,337
I also draw backgrounds and some other elements.

72
0:04:21,362 --> 0:04:26,297
Once that's all done, the animators will be able to create movement out of these artwork elements.

73
0:04:26,322 --> 0:04:31,077
In some cases we have to redraw some frames of the comic

74
0:04:31,102 --> 0:04:36,672
and the changes can be quite dramatic.

75
0:04:36,697 --> 0:04:40,680
Sometimes we can even change the lighting

76
0:04:40,705 --> 0:04:45,521
or composition of the frame. For instance in the sixth scene...

77
0:04:46,769 --> 0:04:48,791
Uhh sorry, I'll have to take only four.

78
0:04:48,816 --> 0:04:50,339
Grrr!

79
0:04:50,364 --> 0:04:51,847
Greetings, good Sir!

80
0:04:51,872 --> 0:04:57,085
We decided to remove the fruits and vegetables to focus on the characters.

81
0:04:57,110 --> 0:05:00,497
There were too many details and the scene was overloaded.

82
0:05:00,522 --> 0:05:04,783
So we redesigned the composition

83
0:05:04,808 --> 0:05:07,521
and extended the background to take a panoramic shot.

84
0:05:07,546 --> 0:05:10,537
Of course, it was very important to keep the original author's style

85
0:05:10,562 --> 0:05:15,482
and make it fit with all the other drawings.

86
0:05:17,727 --> 0:05:23,497
At the next stage we import all the artwork into Blender.

87
0:05:24,428 --> 0:05:28,428
We have to arrange all the pieces correctly, and put everything in place

88
0:05:28,453 --> 0:05:32,642
and link all the parts to the bones.

89
0:05:32,667 --> 0:05:35,855
This work is done by a rigger.

90
0:05:35,880 --> 0:05:40,243
In this project we have the same person responsible for assembling scenes and rigging.

91
0:05:41,539 --> 0:05:47,664
We use the CoaTools plugin to simplify the process of preparing artwork for animation.

92
0:05:51,452 --> 0:05:56,394
The animators do the final version of movement, what you actually will see on the screen.

93
0:05:56,419 --> 0:06:01,990
The animation is the most time-consuming phase. Here we concentrate on

94
0:06:02,015 --> 0:06:06,243
creating the actual movement. We have to make sure it looks good.

95
0:06:06,268 --> 0:06:10,013
The movement should fulfill the director's idea and fit the tempo

96
0:06:10,038 --> 0:06:13,347
and composition defined in the animatic.

97
0:06:13,372 --> 0:06:17,372
The animator develops the main movement with all necessary details.

98
0:06:17,397 --> 0:06:21,397
If a character is walking then they have to move their legs

99
0:06:21,422 --> 0:06:26,918
arms, shoulders and head. And if they are speaking, they must have

100
0:06:26,943 --> 0:06:29,955
their lips moving and eyes blinking,

101
0:06:29,980 --> 0:06:34,272
The hair and clothes also should move as the character moves.

102
0:06:34,297 --> 0:06:36,891
For animation we use Blender.

103
0:06:36,916 --> 0:06:40,463
Blender is known as a powerful open-source software for creating

104
0:06:40,488 --> 0:06:46,455
3D animation and models. But in this project we use it to create a 2D animated comic.

105
0:06:46,480 --> 0:06:51,216
It fits this purpose quite well.

106
0:06:51,241 --> 0:06:55,264
Especially being used together with the CoaTools plug-in.

107
0:06:55,289 --> 0:06:59,331
There are some more peculiar things in our work.

108
0:06:59,355 --> 0:07:03,220
For example creating special effects with Particle Systems.

109
0:07:03,245 --> 0:07:05,164
There is no point in drawing the smoke when we can create it

110
0:07:05,189 --> 0:07:09,093
using simulation in just two clicks.

111
0:07:09,118 --> 0:07:13,537
We often use particle systems for creating some small effects, like dust on the wind, sparkles, etc.

112
0:07:13,562 --> 0:07:18,299
They look very good and entertaining on backgrounds.

113
0:07:20,958 --> 0:07:23,656
And of course after the animation is finished

114
0:07:23,681 --> 0:07:27,259
there will be a final voicing. We send the final animation to the actors

115
0:07:27,284 --> 0:07:30,910
who will do the professional voicing.

116
0:07:30,935 --> 0:07:35,831
They record the voices, then everything is mixed with the sound effects and music

117
0:07:35,856 --> 0:07:38,886
and then we will have a finished episode.

118
0:07:42,513 --> 0:07:47,091
Our production process is completely transparent.

119
0:07:47,116 --> 0:07:52,086
There is a link in the description of this video, which points to our list of tasks.

120
0:07:52,111 --> 0:07:56,111
You can open it and see what we are currently working on.

121
0:07:56,136 --> 0:07:59,524
You can see precisely who is working on which task.

122
0:07:59,549 --> 0:08:03,291
And see the process of work and discussion in its topic.

123
0:08:03,316 --> 0:08:09,864
For example here we can see a task for animation.

124
0:08:09,889 --> 0:08:13,889
We can see all the intermediate versions which are being discussed with the director.

125
0:08:13,914 --> 0:08:18,328
And here is the final variant.

126
0:08:18,353 --> 0:08:22,970
Or here is another example - the task for preparing artwork

127
0:08:22,995 --> 0:08:28,804
There we have a task description which explains how to cut this picture.

128
0:08:28,829 --> 0:08:33,905
The artist posts the interim steps of the work

129
0:08:33,931 --> 0:08:37,931
for everybody to be able to see and other team members can discuss it.

130
0:08:37,956 --> 0:08:41,653
The director can make corrections here

131
0:08:41,678 --> 0:08:44,780
or say "everything is great".

132
0:08:45,466 --> 0:08:50,599
At the moment we are working on the third episode. This episode is less complicated than the previous one.

133
0:08:50,624 --> 0:08:54,511
However I think that it will take us

134
0:08:54,536 --> 0:08:58,536
about four months to finish it. We plan to start production of another episode in parallel soon.

135
0:08:58,561 --> 0:09:03,139
And which episode it will be - will be decided by the voting of our sponsors

136
0:09:03,164 --> 0:09:06,013
who support us on the Patreon platform.

137
0:09:06,038 --> 0:09:10,038
We will continue showing our work process in upcoming backstage videos.

138
0:09:10,063 --> 0:09:13,530
Also you can track our progress

139
0:09:13,555 --> 0:09:17,181
by following us on social media.

140
0:09:17,206 --> 0:09:20,752
See all relevant links in the description of this video.

141
0:09:20,777 --> 0:09:24,014
And that’s all for today! Thank you for watching and see you next time.

Morevna Project presents

2
00:00:07,780 --> 00:00:10,930
“Pepper & Carrot” is an animated adaptation of a comic

3
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:13,640
by the French artist David Revoy.

4
00:00:14,170 --> 00:00:17,970
David is the original author of the comic and our team is producing an animated version.

5
00:00:17,970 --> 00:00:17,990
Right now we are working on a new episode,
David is the original author of the comic and our team is producing an animated version.

6
00:00:17,990 --> 00:00:20,490
Right now we are working on a new episode,

7
00:00:20,530 --> 00:00:23,050
and it is already at the production phase.

8
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:27,660
I can briefly describe the main steps we go through

9
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:31,990
to make an animation from the comic

10
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:37,850
First, the director makes a draft animation

11
00:00:37,870 --> 00:00:43,680
out of static pictures. Here he defines the duration of each scene

12
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:48,020
and outlines how characters and other objects are moving in the scene.

13
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:52,520
The scene drawn by the author already implies

14
00:00:52,540 --> 00:00:56,680
some movement in itself. The director has to analyze this movement

15
00:00:56,700 --> 00:00:59,590
and to understand what the author meant by it.

16
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:03,130
At the same time we record a draft voice soundtrack.

17
00:01:03,150 --> 00:01:07,280
We’re just reading the text aloud here.

18
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:08,800
Good morning Sir,

19
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:11,270
I would like eight pumpkin stars, please

20
00:01:11,300 --> 00:01:14,260
Here you are. That's 60 Ko.

21
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:16,570
Oh dear...

22
00:01:17,980 --> 00:01:21,770
Uhh sorry, I'll have to take only four.

23
00:01:21,790 --> 00:01:22,960
Grrr!

24
00:01:22,980 --> 00:01:26,250
We read aloud and record the words to understand

25
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:30,000
how much time the dialog will take and get its tempo right.

26
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:32,730
Simultaneously, we select the music tracks.

27
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:36,240
So, we create a draft soundtrack and

28
00:01:36,260 --> 00:01:38,540
combine it with the draft visual.

29
00:01:38,570 --> 00:01:41,740
That's what we call an animatic.

30
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:43,890
It gives us the overall picture

31
00:01:43,910 --> 00:01:47,910
and a general idea of what the animators need to do.

32
00:01:48,910 --> 00:01:50,640
The potion contest

33
00:01:50,660 --> 00:01:53,460
Lucky me, I still have a whole day to prepare!

34
00:01:53,490 --> 00:01:55,810
Let's win this challenge!

35
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:59,390
During this process we discuss how we could

36
00:01:59,410 --> 00:02:02,910
improve some moments that can be perfectly understandable in the original comic

37
00:02:02,940 --> 00:02:06,700
but need some clarifications when turned into an animation.

38
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:10,720
So we have the comic, and in fact it has already been directed by the author, right?

39
00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:14,750
The artist drew all of these scenes and arranged them on the page.

40
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:19,580
However while transforming all this into an animated sequence I see that some of these scenes

41
00:02:19,610 --> 00:02:24,530
need something in between, which will connect the previous scene with the next one.

42
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:30,610
That’s why sometimes I’m thinking about how to improve the sequence by adding new elements or even whole shots.

43
00:02:30,630 --> 00:02:34,780
For instance, let's look at this scene with Saffron and the coins.

44
00:02:34,810 --> 00:02:37,760
I thought it would be nice to take a close-up

45
00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:40,180
and show her tossing them.

46
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:44,740
There's no such frame in the original comic, but it connects the scenes

47
00:02:44,770 --> 00:02:49,270
that were there quite well.

48
00:02:49,290 --> 00:02:52,300
When the animatic is ready, we step into the Production phase.

49
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:56,320
As director of this episode, I have the whole picture in my head

50
00:02:56,350 --> 00:03:00,760
and know how every single scene works. Once all of the scenes are arranged into the animatic, I start assigning the tasks

51
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:05,060
to the painters and animators.

52
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:13,480
Every picture has to be cut into parts.

53
00:03:13,510 --> 00:03:17,270
The characters should be separated from the background.

54
00:03:17,290 --> 00:03:21,970
Then we must reconstruct missing parts of the characters or objects,

55
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,310
because when the characters are removed from the background,

56
00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:27,920
we must fill the empty space left behind them.

57
00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:32,400
If a character is meant to move, then some parts of this character

58
00:03:32,430 --> 00:03:35,860
need to be reconstructed and drawn by us. For example in a static picture the hand of the character

59
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:38,670
can be hidden behind another object. And if the character is moving the hand

60
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:40,660
then it must also be drawn by us.

61
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:43,120
Another common case is blinking. We have to draw

62
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:46,060
closed eyes, opened eyes and half-opened eyes.

63
00:03:46,090 --> 00:03:48,440
I always try to carefully analyze each shot, and formulate the task so that the artist only has to do what's necessary

64
00:03:48,470 --> 00:03:51,860
because I already know which elements are going to be animated

65
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:54,630
and which are not. So I just say

66
00:03:54,660 --> 00:03:58,580
this part should be separated and that part should not be.

67
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:01,430
This task is done by our painting artists.

68
00:04:02,460 --> 00:04:05,890
My task is to draw the missing parts

69
00:04:05,910 --> 00:04:09,380
and prepare the artwork for animation.

70
00:04:10,230 --> 00:04:15,100
For drawing and editing pictures we use Krita open source software.

71
00:04:15,470 --> 00:04:19,940
I draw any missing details for the characters, the positions of eyes and mouths,

72
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:24,740
I also draw backgrounds and some other elements.

73
00:04:24,770 --> 00:04:29,700
Once that's all done, the animators will be able to create movement out of these artwork elements.

74
00:04:29,730 --> 00:04:34,480
In some cases we have to redraw some frames of the comic

75
00:04:34,510 --> 00:04:40,080
and the changes can be quite dramatic.

76
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:44,090
Sometimes we can even change the lighting

77
00:04:44,110 --> 00:04:48,930
or composition of the frame. For instance in the sixth scene...

78
00:04:50,170 --> 00:04:52,200
Uhh sorry, I'll have to take only four.

79
00:04:52,220 --> 00:04:53,740
Grrr!

80
00:04:53,770 --> 00:04:55,250
Greetings, good Sir!

81
00:04:55,280 --> 00:05:00,490
We decided to remove the fruits and vegetables to focus on the characters.

82
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:03,900
There were too many details and the scene was overloaded.

83
00:05:03,930 --> 00:05:08,190
So we redesigned the composition

84
00:05:08,210 --> 00:05:10,930
and extended the background to take a panoramic shot.

85
00:05:10,950 --> 00:05:13,940
Of course, it was very important to keep the original author's style

86
00:05:13,970 --> 00:05:18,890
and make it fit with all the other drawings.

87
00:05:21,130 --> 00:05:26,900
At the next stage we import all the artwork into Blender.

88
00:05:27,830 --> 00:05:31,830
We have to arrange all the pieces correctly, and put everything in place

89
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:36,050
and link all the parts to the bones.

90
00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:39,260
This work is done by a rigger.

91
00:05:39,290 --> 00:05:43,650
In this project we have the same person responsible for assembling scenes and rigging.

92
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:51,070
We use the CoaTools plugin to simplify the process of preparing artwork for animation.

93
00:05:54,860 --> 00:05:59,800
The animators do the final version of movement, what you actually will see on the screen.

94
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:05,400
The animation is the most time-consuming phase. Here we concentrate on

95
00:06:05,420 --> 00:06:09,650
creating the actual movement. We have to make sure it looks good.

96
00:06:09,670 --> 00:06:13,420
The movement should fulfill the director's idea and fit the tempo

97
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:16,750
and composition defined in the animatic.

98
00:06:16,780 --> 00:06:20,780
The animator develops the main movement with all necessary details.

99
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:24,800
If a character is walking then they have to move their legs

100
00:06:24,830 --> 00:06:30,320
arms, shoulders and head. And if they are speaking, they must have

101
00:06:30,350 --> 00:06:33,360
their lips moving and eyes blinking,

102
00:06:33,390 --> 00:06:37,680
The hair and clothes also should move as the character moves.

103
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:40,300
For animation we use Blender.

104
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:43,870
Blender is known as a powerful open-source software for creating

105
00:06:43,890 --> 00:06:49,860
3D animation and models. But in this project we use it to create a 2D animated comic.

106
00:06:49,890 --> 00:06:54,620
It fits this purpose quite well.

107
00:06:54,650 --> 00:06:58,670
Especially being used together with the CoaTools plug-in.

108
00:06:58,690 --> 00:07:02,740
There are some more peculiar things in our work.

109
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:06,630
For example creating special effects with Particle Systems.

110
00:07:06,650 --> 00:07:08,570
There is no point in drawing the smoke when we can create it

111
00:07:08,590 --> 00:07:12,500
using simulation in just two clicks.

112
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:16,940
We often use particle systems for creating some small effects, like dust on the wind, sparkles, etc.

113
00:07:16,970 --> 00:07:21,700
They look very good and entertaining on backgrounds.

114
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:27,060
And of course after the animation is finished

115
00:07:27,090 --> 00:07:30,660
there will be a final voicing. We send the final animation to the actors

116
00:07:30,690 --> 00:07:34,320
who will do the professional voicing.

117
00:07:34,340 --> 00:07:39,240
They record the voices, then everything is mixed with the sound effects and music

118
00:07:39,260 --> 00:07:42,290
and then we will have a finished episode.

119
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:50,500
Our production process is completely transparent.

120
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:55,490
There is a link in the description of this video, which points to our list of tasks.

121
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:59,520
You can open it and see what we are currently working on.

122
00:07:59,540 --> 00:08:02,930
You can see precisely who is working on which task.

123
00:08:02,950 --> 00:08:06,700
And see the process of work and discussion in its topic.

124
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:13,270
For example here we can see a task for animation.

125
00:08:13,290 --> 00:08:17,290
We can see all the intermediate versions which are being discussed with the director.

126
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:21,730
And here is the final variant.

127
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:26,380
Or here is another example - the task for preparing artwork

128
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:32,210
There we have a task description which explains how to cut this picture.

129
00:08:32,230 --> 00:08:37,310
The artist posts the interim steps of the work

130
00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:41,340
for everybody to be able to see and other team members can discuss it.

131
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:45,060
The director can make corrections here

132
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:48,190
or say "everything is great".

133
00:08:48,870 --> 00:08:54,000
At the moment we are working on the third episode. This episode is less complicated than the previous one.

134
00:08:54,030 --> 00:08:57,920
However I think that it will take us

135
00:08:57,940 --> 00:09:01,940
about four months to finish it. We plan to start production of another episode in parallel soon.

136
00:09:01,970 --> 00:09:06,540
And which episode it will be - will be decided by the voting of our sponsors

137
00:09:06,570 --> 00:09:09,420
who support us on the Patreon platform.

138
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:13,440
We will continue showing our work process in upcoming backstage videos.

139
00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:16,940
Also you can track our progress

140
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:20,590
by following us on social media.

141

142
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:27,420
And that’s all for today! Thank you for watching and see you next time.

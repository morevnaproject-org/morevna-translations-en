Morevna Project presents

2
00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:15,000
Hello Master! - Hello! - Where are we going today?

3
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:19,000
Hello, my name is Konstantin Dmitriev.

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,020
I am production manager of "Pepper & Carrot" motion comic

5
00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:25.940
which is based on a comic by David Revoy

6
00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:43,000
In this video I invite you

7
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
to plunge into the atmosphere of our studio, where we

8
00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:49.000
all work together

9
00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:51.980
Today we all gathered in the studio

10
00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:55,000
to discuss current production issues

11
00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:58,000
and what tasks we are facing

12
00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:01.000
"I would like eight pumpkin stars, please."

13
00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:04.000
"Here you are! That's sixty Ko."

14
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Yes! Yes!

15
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,020
I am missing more action here... To show how much it all difficult for her...

16
00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:16,000
Maybe add extra scene, at least one there...

17
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:19,000
In all other aspects I like everything. And the rhythm too...

18
00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:23.980
That's it, Carrot! I think, I have everything I need.

19
00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.480
And then we can make a zoom out. Yes.

20
00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:28.660
And do transition through changing opacity... Yes.

21
00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:34.000
Then, this will be one task - to draw Pepper and a closeup of the udder.

22
00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:40.000
By the way, I don't like the tail here. This bump on the tail.

23
00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:45.000
That was in original? - No, I did it...

24
00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:48.000
Well, how about to make it like dragon's tail?

25
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,980
Today our teenager students also came

26
00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:55.000
to our studio.

27
00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:58.000
Some of them help us with production of motion comic.

28
00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:01.000
They are helping us to prepare artwork

29
00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:02.000
for other episodes,

00:02:02,060 --> 00:02:04,000
which we plan to launch in the future.

31
00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:10,000
We prepare artwork for animation.

32
00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:13.220
That means separating characters and objects

33
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:15,000
from background.

34
00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:23.040
So, you finished this one? - Yes, I did.

35
00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:24.980
Now, the next frame,

36
00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:27,000
first of all, you should save it under a different name.

37
00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:44.100
And, of course, the guys don't forget to take a break,

38
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:48,000
to have a rest from the hard and exhausting work of the animator.

39
00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:54,000
Well, that's all!

40
00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:56,000
As usual, you can track our progress

41
00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:58,000
by subscribing to us on social media.

42
00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:01.000
See all relevant links in the description of this video.

43
00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:03.380
We will continue showing our work process

44
00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:05.880
on the motion comic "Pepper & Carrot".

45
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:09,000
Thank you for watching and see you next time! Goodbye!

46
00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:14.980
Well, that's all!

47
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:19,000
As usual, you can track our progress...

48
00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:22.000
Thank you! Thank you...

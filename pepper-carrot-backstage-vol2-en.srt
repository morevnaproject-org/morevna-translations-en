Project "Morevna" presents

2
00:00:10.040 -> 00:00:15,000
Hello Master! - Hello! - Where are we going today?

3
00:00:17,040 -> 00:00:19,000
Hello, my name is Konstantin Dmitriev.

4
00:00:19,000 -> 00:00:22,020
I am responsible for the production of an motion comic

5
00:00:23.020 -> 00:00:25.940
"Pepper & Carrot", based on a comic strip by artist David Revoie

6
00:00:40.020 -> 00:00:43,000
In this issue I invite you

7
00:00:43,000 -> 00:00:45,000
plunge into the atmosphere of our studio, where we

8
00:00:45.020 -> 00:00:49.000
all work together

9
00:00:50.020 -> 00:00:51.980
Today we all gathered in the studio

10
00:00:53.020 -> 00:00:55,000
to discuss current production issues

11
00:00:56.040 -> 00:00:58,000
and what tasks we are facing

12
00:00:59.040 -> 00:01:01.000
"I would like eight pumpkin stars, please."

13
00:01:01.040 -> 00:01:04.000
"Here you are! Sixty Co's for all."

14
00:01:05,000 -> 00:01:07,000
Yes! Yes!

15
00:01:10,000 -> 00:01:13,020
Show a little bit of action ... Wasn't enough ... Why is it all difficult for her ...

16
00:01:14.020 -> 00:01:16,000
Maybe add one frame, at least there ...

17
00:01:16,040 -> 00:01:19,000
Well! I like everything according to the rhythm ...

18
00:01:20.020 -> 00:01:23.980
That's all, Carrot! I think, I have all the necessary.

19
00:01:24.600 -> 00:01:26.480
And then you can make a departure. Yes.

20
00:01:26.680 -> 00:01:28.660
And make the transparency ... Replace with another ... Yes.

21
00:01:29.020 -> 00:01:34.000
Then, this will be one task:draw Pepper and a large udder.

22
00:01:35.020 -> 00:01:40.000
By the way, I don't like the tail a little. This bump on the tail.

23
00:01:40.040 -> 00:01:45.000
This is how it was? - No, I finished it ...

24
00:01:46.020 -> 00:01:48.000
Well, let it be as well as a dragon, like this ...

25
00:01:49,000 -> 00:01:51,980
Students also came to our studio

26
00:01:52.040 -> 00:01:55.000
teenagers who study in our studio.

27
00:01:56.020 -> 00:01:58.000
Some of them help us work on the comic strip.

28
00:01:58.040 -> 00:02:01.000
Particularly, they prepare for animation

29
00:02:01.060 -> 00:02:02.000
other episodes,

thirty
00:02:02,060 -> 00:02:04,000
which we plan to launch in the future.

31
00:02:05.020 -> 00:02:10,000
We prepare material for subsequent animation processing

32
00:02:10.060 -> 00:02:13.220
which can move.
Separating characters and objects

33
00:02:13,220 -> 00:02:15,000
which can move.

34
00:02:18.020 -> 00:02:23.040
Did you make this one? - Yes, I did.

35
00:02:23.080 -> 00:02:24.980
Now, the next frame,

36
00:02:25.060 -> 00:02:27,000
first of all, you should save it under a different name.

37
00:02:40.020 -> 00:02:44.100
And, of course, the guys don't forget to take a break,

38
00:02:44,220 -> 00:02:48,000
to have a rest from the hard and exhausting work of the animator.

39
00:02:53.020 -> 00:02:54,000
Well, that's all!

40
00:02:54.040 -> 00:02:56,000
